This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming:
static variables.
The project get_next_line is straightforward and leaves very little room for bonuses,
but I am sure that you have a lot of imagination. If you aced perfectly the mandatory
part, then by all means complete this bonus part to go further. I repeat, no bonus will
be taken into consideration if the mandatory part isnâ€™t perfect.
Turn-in all 3 initial files with _bonus for this part.
